# 📝 Todo List Application with CI/CD Integration

## 📌 Overview
I have built a **Todo List Application** that includes both frontend and backend functionalities.  
The backend handles storing, updating, and managing todos, while the frontend provides a simple and user-friendly interface to interact with the list.

To improve the **development workflow**, I integrated the project with **CI/CD using GitHub Actions**.  
This ensures that every time I push code to the repository, the pipeline automatically runs checks, builds the application, and deploys it.

## ⚡ CI/CD with GitHub Actions
I set up a **GitHub Actions workflow** for this project to automate the following steps:

1. **Build**  
   - Install dependencies  
   - Compile the project  

2. **Test**  
   - Run unit tests to verify code correctness  
   - Ensure backend API endpoints work properly  

3. **Deploy**  
   - Automatically deploy the application if the build and tests pass

- ✅ Immediate feedback on code changes  
- ✅ Automatic builds and deployments  
- ✅ Improved collaboration through GitHub workflows
